A software engineer and IT enthusiast keen on .NET and VR. *Python's nice too.*

***

Graduated from *Wroc≈Çaw University of Science and Technology* with a Master Degree in *Applied Computer Science*, specializing in *Information System Design*, and a 5.34 GPA. During my studies I focused on:

- Backend and Full-Stack Web Development with .NET
- System Design and Architecture, both Monolithic and Microservices-based
- Data Science and ETL processes in Python and DuckDB
- Knowledge Engineering, integrating LLMs and Semantic Search
- Video Game Development in Unity, with emphasis on VR

...the [CapiLink](./projects/capilink) project being the most notable example of my experience in system design and backend development. I've also created [several](./projects/deadline) [video](./projects/sliding-tactics) [game](./projects/heroes-divided) [projects](./projects/zpi) in Unity, both solo and in teams.

For four years, I've been a member of [KN Robocik](https://robocik.pwr.edu.pl/) science club, where most notably I contributed to the development of autonomous underwater vehicles. My responsibilities included:

- Leading the Unity sub-team in our projects
- [Unity-based simulation environment](./projects/auv-simulator) for live testing of AUV control system, providing [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and ROS2 integration
- Contributions to a custom Python-based control system
- Creation of promotional mini-games and interactive demos using Unity
- Administration of the club's internal services: managing a virtualization platform and integrating an identity provider with SSO capabilities

Carried out internships at [Cat-astrophe Games](https://www.cat-astrophe-games.com/) where I contributed to a now published video game, designing a asset validation framework and a persistence system. During my last semester I worked at the university as an instructor for a *Cloud Programming* course, teaching IaC principles and practices with Terraform and AWS.

Other IT-adjacent skills and interests include raster and vector graphics design, 3D modeling and CAD design for use in 3D printing. In my free time, I enjoy VR excergaming, TTRPGs, playing drums and making DIY musical instruments.
